# Toy-Post-Quantum-Encryptor-PQC-Demo-
Toy Python PQC encryptor modeling lattice-based quantum-safe encryption for secure space communications. This is like a magic box that locks messages so even super-smart computers (quantum) can't pick it. It uses a simple "lattice" lock (PQC style) to hide text, then unlocks it.
